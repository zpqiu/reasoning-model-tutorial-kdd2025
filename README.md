## 🎯 Tutorial Abstract

<div class="modern-card">

With reasoning models like **DeepSeek-R1** and **OpenAI's o1** demonstrating breakthrough capabilities in complex problem-solving, there's growing interest in the AI community about how to unlock similar capabilities in other large language models (LLMs). 

This hands-on tutorial dives into practical methods for building reasoning capabilities in LLMs through two primary approaches:
- **Knowledge Distillation**: Transferring capabilities from advanced reasoning models
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Further enhancing capabilities through post-training techniques

Participants will learn how to transfer reasoning capabilities from cutting-edge models like DeepSeek-R1 into smaller LLMs such as Qwen and Llama, and then explore how reinforcement learning can take these capabilities even further.

</div>

## 👥 Target Audience and Prerequisites

<div class="modern-card">

**Target audience**: Data scientists and engineers who are interested in enhancing reasoning capabilities in LLMs for downstream tasks.

**Skill Level**: The tutorial will be designed to accommodate participants with varying levels of expertise, from beginners to moderately skilled users, with the pace set to ensure beginners can follow comfortably.

**Prerequisites**: 
- Basic knowledge of deep learning and LLM concepts
- Familiarity with Python programming
